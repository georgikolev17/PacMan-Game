This is a modified Pac-Man game made on Java Swing. The game's difficulty gets increasingly harder until the player dies.
!!! IMPORTANT !!!
Coins are spawned only on the first line only for easier testing. If you want to run the full version of the game - with coins everywhere, go to Map.java and remove the if-statement on line 108.
